# Basic Design

I've been trying to keep this separated into:

A engine that might be useful for other simulations down the road. You get a *very* *very* barebones
engine that has stuff like spawning entities, driving the simulation, rendering the world.

A simulation part that sits on top of the engine. Defining specific behaviours of entities, their textures and that sort of thing.
